# Heatwave

## Heat and health

- Heatwaves are among the most dangerous natural hazards; rarely receive adequate attention — impacts not always immediately obvious
  - Dehydration (脱水), heat cramps (热痉挛), heat stroke (热休克)
  - Exacerbate respiratory conditions (呼吸系统疾病), cardiovascular 心血管的, chronic 慢性的 illness (renal disease 肾脏疾病)
  - Increase strain (紧张, 负担) on water, enegy and transport ->power disruption (电力中断)
    - people suffer power cuts after equipment overheats
  - Loss of crops or livestock (牲畜, 家畜) -> food and livelihood security
  - Medicines needing refrigeration are vulnerable
  - Mental health. Educational settings
- Effects of heat may be exacerbated in cities, due to the urban heat island effect
- Older people
- Multiple vulnerabilities increase the risk of health impacts
  - the less abled, pregnant, or already infirm (体弱多病的)
  - the poor, displaced (无家可归的), and homeless
  - Children and the elderly
  - athletes
  - Outdoor and manual workers

## Adaptation methods review

- 8 categories of methods
  - Analogue (相似物, 类似事情) location
  - Analogue period
  - Threshold shift 阈值变动
  - Adjustment of slope or relative risks (RR)
    - **Slope** refers to the **rate of change** in the response or outcome as the input variable changes.
    - **Relative Risk (RR)** is a metric often used in epidemiology or risk analysis to quantify the likelihood of an outcome (e.g., disease or failure) under specific conditions compared to a baseline. 相对危险度（RR）是流行病学或风险分析中常用的度量标准，用于量化与基线相比在特定条件下出现结果（如疾病或失败）的可能性。
  - change in exposure through built/natural environment
  - socioeconomic adaptive capacity
  - Combination of threshold and slope/RR
  - Other
- Fewer than 1 in 5 studies were identified as using an intervention-based empirical basis for statistical assumptions. 使用基于干预的经验基础进行统计假设
- Including adaptation in projections considerably influences estimated mortality, with some offsetting the increase due to temperature rises, while some suggested un-adaption (不适应) to cold.
